## Todo

#### Write a robust installation script.
It should accept a JSON file describing how to install the dotfiles.  
It should allow easy installation of dotfiles.  
It should be cross-platform.  
It should be extremely safe.

#### Make the Git status inside the Bash prompt work.

#### Fill out the features section of the readme.

#### Normalize indent style and line endings.

## Features

#### Bash

#### Vim

#### Tmux

#### Dircolors

#### Tilix

## Installation

To install the dotfiles, simply run `./install`.

It will then link and copy all dotfiles into the appropriate destinations.  
It will prompt you before overwriting any existing files.
